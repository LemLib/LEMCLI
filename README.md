# LemCLI
Welcome to LemCLI! This open-source CLI aims to give users a better experience with building projects, managing packages, and uploading programs.

The creation of this template was inspired by [pros-cli](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli). We aim to develop a library that strikes a balance between ease-of-use, comprehensive functionality, and maintainability.
